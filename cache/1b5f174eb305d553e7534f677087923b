There's no need to rub it in, because Gillian Flynn's latest novel of psychological suspense will confound anyone trying to keep up with her quicksilver mind and diabolical rules of play. Not that there's anything underhanded about her intentions: she promises to deliver an account of the troubled marriage of Nick and Amy Dunne, who alternate as narrators, and so she does. The trickery is in the devilish way she tells their story. On the occasion of this young couple's fifth wedding anniversary, Nick tries to ignore the big questions weighing on his mind (''What have we done to each other? What will we do?'') and steels himself for the elaborate and humiliating treasure hunt his wife always makes of her gift presentation. But Nick's brooding takes a darker turn when Amy disappears, amid signs of a struggle, from their house on the Mississippi River in North Carthage, Mo., and he suffers the painful transformation from distressed husband to suspected murderer.", "pub_date": "2012-06-15T00:00:00Z", "keywords": [{"value": "GONE GIRL (BOOK)", "name": "creative_works"}, {"value": "AN UNMARKED GRAVE (BOOK)", "name": "creative_works"}, {"value": "WITNESS THE NIGHT (BOOK)", "name": "creative_works"}, {"value": "THE LAST KIND WORDS (BOOK)", "name": "creative_works"}, {"value": "FLYNN, GILLIAN", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "TODD, CHARLES", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "PICCIRILLI, TOM", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "DESAI, KISHWAR", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE", "name": "subject"}], "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/books/review/gillian-flynns-gone-girl-and-more.html", "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "source": "The New York Times", "word_count": 904, "section_name": "Books; Arts", "_id": "4fdf02ca32439115e30b686a", "abstract": "Marilyn Stasio reviews books Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, The Last Kind Words by Tom Piccirilli, An Unmarked Grave by Charles Todd and Witness the Night by Kishwar Desai.
